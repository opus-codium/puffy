# Test configuration for forwarding traffic on podman1 interface
# This uses the 'forward' direction to create FORWARD chain rules
# A single forward rule with 'on' automatically creates both -i and -o variants

node 'podman-host' do
  # Allow forwarding on podman1 interface (creates both -i and -o rules)
  pass forward on 'podman1' all
